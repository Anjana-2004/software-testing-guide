## Introduction to Software Testing

Software testing is a systematic process that verifies whether the developed software meets the specified requirements and functions as expected. It helps identify bugs, errors, or missing requirements in the software.

### Why Software Testing is Important
- Detects bugs and issues early, reducing cost and time.
- Ensures the software meets user and business expectations.
- Improves product stability, security, and performance.
- Provides a better user experience.

### Benefits of Software Testing
- **Improved Quality:** Ensures the software behaves correctly across different scenarios.
- **User Confidence:** Builds trust in the stability and functionality of the product.
- **Reduced Failures:** Identifies defects before deployment.
- **Better Maintenance:** Provides long-term stability and reduces technical debt.

### Continuous Improvement in Testing
- Adding edge cases and boundary value scenarios.
- Updating test cases as the product evolves.
- Using advanced automation frameworks for efficiency.
- Increasing test coverage with both manual and automated tests.

## Agile Development & Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Agile Development
Agile is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It promotes continuous improvement through short development cycles known as sprints.

#### Key Agile Principles:
- Deliver working software frequently.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
- Close collaboration between developers, testers, and stakeholders.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Test-Driven Development is a software development practice where test cases are written **before** writing the actual code.

#### TDD Cycle:
1. **Write a failing test.**
2. **Write minimal code to pass the test.**
3. **Refactor the code to improve quality.**
4. **Repeat the cycle.**

#### Benefits of TDD:
- Leads to better-designed, more maintainable code.
- Ensures high test coverage.
- Helps in finding bugs early.
- Makes future code changes safer.

## Manual Testing Example - OpenCart

### Application Under Test:
[OpenCart Demo Website](https://demo.opencart.com/)

Manual testing is the process of testing software manually without automation tools. It involves executing test cases step-by-step to verify that the application works as expected.

### Test Case Document:
- [ManualTesting_OpenCart.xlsx](./ManualTesting_OpenCart.xlsx)

This file contains **25 well-defined test cases** covering:
- Homepage navigation
- Product search
- Add to cart functionality
- Checkout process
- Negative and failure scenarios

These test cases simulate real user interactions and check if the OpenCart demo site behaves correctly under various input and navigation flows.

## Introduction to Selenium IDE

Selenium IDE is a browser-based automation tool that allows testers to record, edit, and replay test cases. It is suitable for quickly automating web testing without programming knowledge.

### Key Features:
- Record and playback browser actions.
- Export tests to languages like Python, Java, and C#.
- Build and execute test suites.
- Simple graphical interface.

### Other Automation Tools:
- **Selenium WebDriver:** Script-based browser automation.
- **Cypress:** Modern web testing framework.
- **Katalon Studio:** End-to-end automation testing platform.

## Selenium IDE Example - PHPTravels

### Application Under Test:
[PHPTravels Demo Website](https://phptravels.net/)

### Selenium IDE Project:
- [phptravels_flight_booking.side](./SeleniumIDEProjects/phptravels_flight_booking.side)

This project demonstrates an end-to-end automated flow:
- Searching for flights
- Navigating to hotel bookings
- Completing the booking form

### How to Run:
1. Install the Selenium IDE browser extension (available for Chrome and Firefox).
2. Import the `.side` project file into Selenium IDE.
3. Play the test case to see the automated steps in action.

This example helps visualize how Selenium IDE can quickly automate user workflows on web applications.

## Selenium WebDriver Script

For learners who wish to explore coding-based automation, this project also includes a Python Selenium WebDriver script:

- [test_phptravels.py](./SeleniumWebDriverScripts/test_phptravels.py)

This script automates the same booking process as the Selenium IDE project but with more control and flexibility using Python code.

## Testing Type Classification

| Testing Type         | OpenCart (Manual Testing) | PHPTravels (Selenium IDE Testing) |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Unit Testing         | ❌ Not Performed          | ❌ Not Performed                  |
| Integration Testing  | ❌ Not Performed          | ❌ Not Performed                  |
| System Testing       | ✅ Performed              | ✅ Performed                      |
| Regression Testing   | ✅ If repeated            | ✅ If repeated                    |
| Automation           | ❌ Manual                 | ✅ Automated                      |

### Explanation:
- **Unit Testing:** Testing individual components or functions in isolation. Not covered in this project.
- **Integration Testing:** Testing the interaction between modules or systems. Not performed here.
- **System Testing:** Testing the complete application workflow from start to finish. Both OpenCart and PHPTravels tests fall into this category.
- **Regression Testing:** If the same test cases are rerun after code changes, they can serve as regression tests to ensure nothing is broken.
